            <p>Shaky threw a party that lasted all night
            Everybody drank a lot of something nice
            There was an old fashioned band of married men
            Looking up to me for encouragement it was so-so
            The ladies looked bad but the music was sad</p>

            <p>He looked a lot like Che Guevara, drove a diesel van
              Kept his gun in quiet seclusion, such a humble man
              The only survivor of the National People's Gang
              Panic in Detroit, I asked for an autograph
              He wanted to stay home, I wish someone would phone</p>

          <div class="about">
            <p>
              The sniper in the brain, regurgitating drain
              Incestuous and vain,
              and many other last names
              I look at my watch it say 9:25 and I think
              "Oh God I'm still alive"
